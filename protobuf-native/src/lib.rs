//! # Details
//!
//! This crate contains handwritten bindings to libprotobuf facilitated by
//! [cxx]. The API that is exposed is extremely specific to the few users of
//! this library and is subject to frequent change.
//!
//! Depending on your use case, the auto-generated bindings in [protobuf-sys]
//! may be more suitable.
