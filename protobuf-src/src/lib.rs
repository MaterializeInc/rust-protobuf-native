//! # Details
//!
//! This crate builds a vendored copy of libprotobuf and protoc using Cargo's
//! support for custom build scripts. It is not intended for direct consumption,
//! but as a dependency for other crates that need libprotobuf or protoc
//! available, like [prost-build].
//!
//! protobuf-src is currently bundling protobuf [v3.19.1].
//!
//! To use this crate, declare a `dependency` or `dev-dependency` on
//! `protobuf-src`. Then, in the build script for your crate, the environment
//! variable `DEP_PROTOBUF_SRC_ROOT` will point to the directory in which the
//! bundled copy of protobuf has been installed. You can build and link another
//! C/C++ library against this copy of libprotobuf or generate Rust bindings and
//! link Rust code against this copy of libprotobuf.
//!
//! If you simply need to invoke the vendored protoc binary, [`protoc`] returns
//! the path to pass to [`std::process::Command`].
